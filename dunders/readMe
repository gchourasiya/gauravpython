#Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores.
#They are also called dunder methods. Magic methods are not meant to be invoked directly by you,
but the invocation happens internally from the class on a certain action.
For example, when you add two numbers using the + operator, internally, the __add__() method will be called.
